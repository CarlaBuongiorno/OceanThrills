      `Le Morne Beach, under the shadow of the mighty Le Morne Brant mountains, is known as the ultimate surfing spot in the 
    country. This top Mauritius surf spot is famous for the ‘One Eye’, the ‘eye’ surfers see on Le Morne’s rock face when 
    they find the sweet spot in which to catch the perfect wave! If you’re a beginner, test your skills on the west side of 
    the peninsula. This location is also known as ‘Kite Lagoon’, due to it being a popular venue for kitesurfing in Mauritius. 
    Enjoy some of the best swells of incredibly high waves on the island (averaging 3.5 feet). You can rent a board at Pryde Shop, 
    which is less than a 10-minute drive from Le Morne Beach. Call them at +230 5989 1060. Open 09:00 to 19:00, every day.

    If the inconsistencies of Tamarin Bay leave you feeling a little out of your depth, then the surf at Le Morne Peninsula 
    will be your saviour. Le Morne is home to some of the best swells on the island, yet is arguably more hospitable for novice 
    surfers than areas such as Tamarin Bay.

    Tucked away in the farthest south-westerly corner of Mauritius, Le Morne will greet you with the call of the Roaring Forties – 
    the strong westerly winds found in the Southern Hemisphere. But you will also be welcomed by regular swells of impressively high waves.
    
    The award-winning adventure travel blog Ordinary Traveler shares many valuable travel tips for visiting Mauritius. Blog owner 
    Christy told us how Le Morne offers more than conventional surfing: “Mauritius is home to a world-class windsurfing spot — 
    right next to the St. Regis on Le Morne Peninsula. As long as it’s not too windy, you can paddle past the lagoon to One Eye 
    for some of the best waves in Mauritius.”
    
    Sheltered by Le Morne Brabant Mountain, this area has fewer rocks and less prominent reefs, meaning beginners can ply their trade 
    here with ease. The conditions range from lagoon-like calmness to more hard-core swells, perfect for those seeking a challenge.

    As Christy recommends, experienced surfers should head out to One Eye. This is an exposed reef break that can be found in front 
    of the St. Regis Hotel. To make the most of the superb swells, tackle the waves at high tide with some extremely fast currents to 
    propel you. Surfing legend says that if you manage to catch the perfect wave at One Eye and can ride it to the top, you will be 
    rewarded with a clear view of the break in the reef and the opening, or ‘eye’, in the face of Le Morne Mountain.

    Further out to sea is Manawa. Best reached by boat, this is another exposed reef break like One Eye. Here you are treated to 
    consistent large waves and strong south-easterly offshore winds.

    Shielded by the defensive look of Le Morne Brabant Mountain, the waters of the Le Morne cape are presently seemingly the most 
    prevalent spot to surf in Mauritius. About 30 minutes south of Tamarin Bay, on the island's far southwestern furthest point, Le 
    Morne offers both level tidal pond conditions for absolute amateurs to discover their ocean legs, and challenging surf spots for 
    experienced surfers to test their courage. One such spot – an uncovered reef break known as One Eye – is found just in front of 
    the St. Regis resort. It's best surfed at elevated tide when the tide is as yet rising, however with truly quick currents, it's 
    one for the specialist surfers only.

    Another professional surf spot with a genuine reputation is Manawa, a likewise uncovered reef break 2km out to ocean before 
    the Indian Resort and Spa. Best reached by a boat, you'll find reliably enormous waves and offshore breezes blowing in from 
    the southeast.

    Internationally recognised as one of the world’s best places to go kitesurfing, Le Morne is equally phenomenal (and famous) 
    for those wanting to hit the waves harness-free. Situated in the southwest of the island, surfers are afforded the opportunity 
    of surfing in Mauritius with a spectacular and unique view of one of the island’s UNESCO World Heritage Sites—Le Morne Brabant 
    mountain. The great news about this gorgeous spot on the Mauritian coastline is that it’s not reserved exclusively for experts: 
    The Le Morne lagoon makes for an excellent place for beginners to learn the art of surfing on the tamer swells, while experts 
    can look forward to the challenge of ‘Manawa’ or the famed ‘One Eye’.

    One Eye is best tackled during high tide (more specifically on the pushing tide as the water just starts to fill up on the bank).
    This difficult spot is famous for the exposed reef break but, searchers beware, the waves are made up of fast and steep, left-hand 
    peaks which break a lot heavier than expected and the currents can be strong. Manawa is just across the channel and offers a smaller, 
    slightly more manageable wave for most with this reef break handling anything from one metre to eight metre walls. It has also won 
    itself recognition amongst the pro surfers of the world, thanks to offshore southeasterly winds that create consistently solid waves.

    The easiest way to reach either of these spots is by speedboat and it’s a good idea to employ the services of the emergency 
    speedboats before you go into the water, especially if you are interested in testing your mettle with One Eye. The old surfer’s 
    adage ‘when in doubt, don’t go out’ couldn't be truer than when surfing some of the most challenging spots on the island. Something 
    for the general surfer to remember when surfing these two breaks is that they are kitesurfer havens and the line-up will be crowded 
    when the wind is up.`,

      `One of the major drawcards of Tamarin Bay is the lack of high-walled resort compounds. 
    It’s also a superb location for newbies hoping to find great conditions to learn to surf in Mauritius.

    The now-popular Tamarin Bay lies on the south-west coast of Mauritius, but until the 1960s it was relatively unknown. 
    Surfed only by locals and the most hard core Australian surfers, Tamarin Bay was a hidden treasure of a cove. It wasn’t 
    until the 1974 cult surfing documentary The Forgotten Island of Santosha exposed Tamarin Bay’s infamous 10-foot wave that 
    the Bay became more widely known. Its left-hand reef break became legendary, and surfing enthusiasts from around the world 
    began placing the Bay at the top of their bucket lists. Since the ’70s, the currents and wind patterns around the Bay have 
    changed, making the surf somewhat inconsistent for those hungry to relive the swell presented in the documentary. Instead, 
    surfers began heading for the nearby island of Réunion. Nonetheless, Tamarin Bay is still widely regarded as a world-class 
    place to surf. Tamarin Bay is certainly a spot for more experienced surfers, but there is a local surf school for children 
    or first-timers who are keen to learn surfing during their holiday to Mauritius. Unlike the northern side of the island, 
    this area of Mauritius has not seen the same level of development that you would expect of a tourist destination. Instead 
    Tamarin Bay has maintained the authentic and unique vibe that makes it perfectly suited to a surfing community.

    Close to Flic-en-Flac on the western side of the island, you’ll find one of the most famous spots to go surfing in Mauritius—Tamarin 
    Bay. Once a surf spot exclusively known to die-hard wave chasers and savvy locals (in the 1960s), Tamarin Bay was put on the 
    proverbial map by a film made in 1974 called Forgotten Island of Santosha and images from that film published by Surfer Magazine. 
    It didn’t take long for surfers across the world to set out on a surfing mission to Mauritius in search of Tamarin Bay’s ‘perfect wave’ 
    depicted in the film—a lengthy left-handed reef break—with sizeable three metre swells being handled with ease. In fact, this was 
    true to such an extent, that surfers nicknamed Mauritius the “Forgotten Island of Santosha” itself. At one point, the bay apparently 
    became so popular that some locals, especially white Mauritians called the “White Shorts” were concerned they would miss out and 
    visitors would monopolize the surf. Happily, this seems to be something of the past, and as long as locals are shown due respect and 
    you are prepared to wait for your turn patiently too—as is true for every other surf spot in the world famous or not—you won’t have 
    any trouble.
    
    While the movie might have captured Tamarin Bay at its absolute best, the reality is that the surf tends to be slightly inconsistent, 
    depending on the currents and wind patterns present, but when the conditions are optimal, it’s undoubtedly one of the best spots to 
    go surfing in Mauritius. It’s great to surf between eight and nine in the morning while conditions are most favourable and the area 
    uncrowded. When the right conditions do present themselves, it’s possible to surf huge, powerful waves that tend to barrel from the 
    take-off zone. The most reliable waves here occur from October onwards, and you generally have the chance to surf during all tides. 
    As with most reef breaks, it’s important to be very cautious if you are surfing here during low tide. While the big waves are 
    certainly best left to the professionals, there are areas in Tamarin Bay that are appropriate for beginners.
    
    If you are looking for an excellent place to stay during your trip to Mauritius, that’s just a stone’s throw from Tamarin Bay and 
    Le Morne, then look no further than Sugar Beach. Our exquisite plantation-style luxury hotel serves as the ideal place to rest and 
    relax after a long, albeit satisfying, day chasing perfect waves. And what’s more, we have a huge variety of complimentary activities 
    for days when the swell is just not up to scratch, from stand up paddle boarding to windsurfing, snorkelling and more. Get in touch 
    with us to plan your next surfing adventure in Mauritius.

    The significant surf seashores in Mauritius are all in the south and west of the island, and just beneath Flic en Flac on the 
    western coast is the best known of them all: the Tamarin Bay. Dating back to the 1960s, this was as yet a moderately obscure spot, 
    surfed distinctly by high-class local people in addition to a bunch of hardcore (predominantly Australian) wave chasers from abroad. 
    Actually, Tamarin’s popularity began when The Forgotten Island of Santosha was invented. It’s basically an elite 1974 surf narrative 
    that focused on the bay’s incredibly long left-hand reef break and its 10 foot long swells.

    Nowadays, changes in the currents and flows, along with the wind patterns have made Tamarin a far less predictable bet than in years 
    back, but when the water conditions are great, this is as yet a world-class spot to surf. In case you're a beginner, visit the surf 
    school at the imperatively retro Tamarin Hotel for exercises, or just fly in for a talk about the most recent wave conditions.
    
    Back ashore, an absence of large scale advancement implies that this place still holds something of an old-school vibe, making it a 
    particularly well-known destination for the more boho visitors.`,

      `One of the least developed areas of Mauritius, Rivière des Galets offers you a more peaceful atmosphere than some of the other 
    popular Mauritius surf spots. You can look forward to a rewarding surfing experience thanks to the left-hand surf breaks and the 
    moderately exposed reef. It’s a highly recommended location for more advanced surfers seeking consistent and phenomenal waves. 
    The only time it gets busy at Rivière des Galets is during the surfing competitions that take place throughout the year. Check 
    with the locals when you’re in the area to plan when to go surfing.

    Generally, the best places to go surfing in Mauritius are on the south and west coasts. The south coast itself offers some 
    incredible gems for the avid surfer, but Rivière des Galets could be deemed the crown jewel. Surrounded by incredible stretches 
    of tropical scenery, sheer cliffs and untouched coastlines, it’s an exceptional spot for advanced surfers seeking some phenomenal 
    waves that tend to be consistent, thanks to a partially exposed coral reef which forms a classic left-hand reef break. The rugged 
    pebble beach here stands out as being unusual on an island where the famed beaches are those with powdered white sandy shores. 
    This makes for not only an incredible surf spot—due to the water pulling harder off the rocks than it can off the sand—but an 
    amazing change in scenery.

    Once you travel about 20km further east along the twisting south coast street, you'll arrive at the town of Riviere des Galets. 
    Here you will find an uncovered reef and left-hand surf break, which will offer you with dependable waves in case you are a pro 
    surfer. It's additionally only an extraordinary spot to unwind and appreciate the characteristic setting – here on the south shore 
    of Mauritius you'll discover the islands most out of control and least created stretch of coastline, complete with dramatic ocean 
    cliffs and thrashing waves made by the gaps in the reef.

    Just toward the west of the town itself, the minor Ilôt Sancho – which, being only a couple of meters offshore, is easily accessible 
    by foot during low tide – offers both left and right-hand reef breaks and trustworthy surf conditions. In spite of being less notable 
    among guests than either Le Morne or Tamarin Bay, this has regularly been an area for local surf competitions and can get truly 
    bustling when the conditions are correct. What's more, if, for reasons unknown you don't like getting your shorts wet, it's likewise 
    an incredible spot to just sit back, relax and have a glimpse of the natural beauty.

    Rivière des Galets is a small village 20km further east of Le Morne and Tamarin Bay. More reliable than Tamarin, the left-hand surf 
    breaks and moderately exposed reef of the Rivière des Galets offers surf that is consistently rewarding.

    What puts Rivière des Galets among the best surf locations in Mauritius isn’t only the waves, but is also the peaceful atmosphere of 
    the area. This part of the island is certainly one of the least developed, and the community remains truly in touch with their natural 
    surroundings.
    
    Countless subtle surprises can be found in the Rivière des Galets. Its pebble beach is unique within Mauritius, creating a charming

     share the same spot and you will never see them together: If the Spinners are around and the Bottlenose dolphins arrive, the Spinners 
     will leave the bay, heading to the open sea.

    Being one of the most common species, the Bottlenose dolphin is known all over the world. It is also the biggest amongst the different 
    species of dolphins with a weight of up to 650 kg and a length of up to 12 feet! They are famous for their intelligence, very gentle 
    and willing to approach humans.
    
    In Mauritius, they live in groups of 2 to 15 members and can be observed early in the morning until 11:30 a.m. Sometimes, with a bit 
    of luck, you may see them in the afternoon, swimming in the crystal clear lagoon, in 1.5 meters depth water.
    
    The most playful of the dolphins, the Spinners, live in large groups of up to 100 members. Much smaller than their fellow peers, the
    Bottlenose, they grow up to 80 kg and 8 feet. Famous for being very active, they play together as the morning is their time to train

    offers a great spot for the beginners taking kitesurfing lessons, but also freestyle and freeriders.
    The Kite lagoon as the locals call it is one of the very few kitespots suitable for the beginners. At least on a good day it is. 
    But in strong winds, it gets pretty choppy and if the large swell hits, oh boy here comes the vicious current.
    The water could get pretty shallow, so watch out for the odd coral head poking out.

    don’t really have a lot of control yet, so you have to pick a lucky day 😉 I usually escaped to the left side of he lagoon (when 
    looking at it from the beach) and more upwind which has pretty sweet flatwater. It can get very shallow so make sure to check the

      beach and the best preserved coral reef lagoon on the entire island.
    Pointe d’Esny beach is without the doubt a well hidden gem and surely takes a proud spot in our best secret kitespots top ten.
    
    The bummer is that the beach is effectively sealed off by a few luxurious private properties, so unless you happen to be staying in 
    one of the beachfront resorts, the only way to get to this secret beach is either by water or by foot.
    You can either take a long beach walk all the way from Blue Bay, which is worth the hassle anyways or your other option would be to 
    take this little, just about 150 metres long pathway that’s just off the main Costal Road.
    This tiny pathway sits just in between a couple of the private houses and if you manage to find it, it will lead you to the Paradise 
    beach. So if you enjoy geo-caching, there you’re go, go find the treasure!

    Kitesurfing Holidays At Pointe D'esny, Mauritius
Pointe d'Esny is situated on the South East coast of Mauritius. Boasting the island’s whitest stretch of beach and located a mere 
15-minute drive from the airport, Pointe d'Esny offers a secluded, peaceful location in one of Mauritius' untouched areas. Offering a 
tropical paradise setting, fit for any postcard, this part of Mauritius boasts the largest lagoon on the island. Not far away is the 
charming historical village of Mahebourg, however, the real charm of Pointe d'Esny is that it is located away from the crowds and 
commercial resorts found elsewhere in Mauritius.

The large flat water lagoon, with its light to moderate winds provides a haven for foilers and those who want to learn how to kite foil.

The Spot At Pointe D'esny
The kite spot at Pointe d'Esny has yet to be discovered by the masses and as a result offers a tranquil, quiet playground where you can 
really enjoy your time on the water. There is just a small school operated here by the Mauritian kitesurfer that developed the click-bar. 
Just off a sparkling white beach, a deep flat water lagoon stretches out for a long distance before the reef, providing a blue playground 
that is just perfect for foiling. The wind here is generally South or South-East which is cross-shore. There is generally a line of small 
boats at anchor close to the shore so basic skills are needed to get out beyond these to really enjoy the freedom this spot offers. The 
wind is consistent and clean but is lighter than some of the more popular kitesurf spots on the island so big kites are needed while 
foiling is the real highlight of this destination. The best months to kitesurf at Pointe d'Esny is between June and September, but you 
can find wind here all year round.`,

      bask in the glory.
    Palmar is a few kilometres long stretch of an awesome lagoon with water not too deep and pretty stable 45 degree onshore wind.

      `This is the real treat for the wave riders and one of the most respected wave kitesurfing spots on the island. It could be a real 
      challenge even for the pro kiters due to the fast viciously punchy left handers. One Eye is a legendary bone-crunching wave rolling 
      just outside the reef protecting the its lagoon. It is one of the world’s fastest & cleanest waves that can deliver the biggest 
      wipeouts ever. On good days, the wave breaks and forms a perfect tube that goes for hundreds of meters along the reef. One Eye can 
      give you the best ride of your life, but don’t you dare to under estimate it.
      There’s a rumour going around about a windsurfer who got his lower leg double fractured. The story says that he was thrown out of 
      One Eye’s lip onto the flats. He just could’t stand the punch and hard landing and his leg just buckled under the massive pressure.
       The broken bone went through the deck into the core of his board. With such horror story in mind, you do need to pay a lot of 
       respect even just looking at the way from far away.
      While One Eye is definitely the most respected beasts in Le Morne, not many riders realise that the real danger is actually 
      somewhere else. If you look at some of the drone shots in the photo gallery below, you’ll realise that the entire lagoon flows 
      towards one massive exit.
      The waves push the water over the shallow reef to the huge channel. If you happen to get in to trouble at this point, there’s no 
      other chance than getting rescued. Self rescue or swimming against the current with the outgoing tide is just not an option. The 
      rescue boat services are available for emergencies in Le Morne, so if you are about to do some shredding, it would be wise to book 
      it for your session.`,

    Belle Mare Kitesurf Holiday Overview
On the east coast of Mauritius, 1km south from Belle Mare village, lays the picturesque beach Palmar. Palmar, like Le Morne on the south 
coast, is world renowned for being an incredibly beautiful beach offering a wide variety of watersports. Both destinations are must see 
kitesurf, SUP, and surf destinations. The kiting at Belle Mare offers beautifully flat and uncrowded water inside a closed turquoise 
lagoon with no currents or boat traffic. 

What sets the east coast of Mauritius apart from many other destinations is the variety of organised downwinders. The east coast is the 
perfect place to go on a downwinder as the combination of flat water and waves to kite on throughout the journey, along with the crystal 
clear waters will keep you mesmerised.

      `Situated near the wreck site of Djabeda, Coin de Mire provides a gorgeous view for people who want to go scuba diving in 
      Mauritius. The ocean floor covered with pinkish coral reefs, seabeds and rocks are truly a breathtaking sight for the divers. 
      Though the site is one of the most popular sites for underwater photography, it is better to stay on the shallower part of the 
      reef to avoid drifting away due to strong currents. Many species like eagle rays, dog-tooth tunas and turtles can be observed on 
      the reef.

      The highlight here is the Djabeda wreck dive, which is completely covered in stunning pink soft coral. Octopus, scorpionfish, 
      stonefish, lionfish, and many reef fish are common here. Other creatures that can be found here include Barracuda, dolphins, 
      and stingrays.

      A little offshore, about 90 minutes from the mainland, the islands Coin de Mire is perfect for beginner divers 
      and snorkellers. Some of the best snorkelling in Mauritius is around these turquoise lagoons. You might just be lucky enough to 
      spot some dolphins and sharks further out in the bay!

      Coin de Mire is a small, peculiar looking island lying 8 km to the north of Mauritius with what many consider to be the best 
      diving in Mauritius. Dives often feature wall and wreck diving with spectacular visibility (50m/200ft on a great day), as well 
      as chances to see large pelagics such as marlin. Its unique geology makes for some interesting underwater canyons and crevices 
      that can be quite fun to swim through.
      Perhaps the highlight of all dives at Coin de Mire is the Djabeda wreck dive. The wreck is a 144ft/44m long Japanese fishing 
      vessel sitting perfectly upright at a depth of approximately 100ft/30m. Completely covered in beautiful pink soft coral, the 
      wreck attracts perhaps the largest concentration of fish life on the north side of the island. Octopus, scorpionfish, stonefish, 
      lionfish, and many reef fish are common here. Less common are barracuda, dolphins, and sting rays.

      `St. Jacques is one of the most popular sites for scuba diving in Mauritius. The diving trip starts in the lagoon, which is less 
      than 5 metres deep. The water currents then take the divers away to the coral walls and underwater caves. Rock pinnacles will also 
      be visible in these waters.

      The maximum depth is about 30 metres where the drift drive ends. In these waters, one can come across eagle rays, stingrays, 
      turtles, reef sharks and few other large species.  This dive is not suitable for beginners due to strong currents. The best time 
      for diving here is the period between November and May. Blue gorgonian fans, hard and soft corals, sharks, schools of trevallies, 
      and Tuna can also be seen.

      Kind of maybe more the south coast but you can reach Passe St Jacques from Le Morne so it still counts! It’s another choice but 
      reserved for the advanced divers due to the technicality of the site. Drift-diving means diving using transportation by the 
      underwater currents and the pull at Passe St Jacques is known for getting pretty strong.

      How’s the reward though? Smashing.

      The underwater life here is superb with a huge variety of ecosystems interacting. It’s not just the pacifists either. This is a 
      real good spot to see some of Mauritius’s underwater predators as they loiter the current waiting for outgoing prey.

      Eagle rays, barracudas, and even sharks are a real possibility here as well as schools of different fish like trevallies and 
      tuna. If you’re keen to see the merciless savagery of nature at its finest (as things are devoured before your very eyes), it’s 
      the best place to go in Mauritius!

      `Having a northern plateau descending in stages from 13 metres to 20 metres, Caravelle is a fantastic dive site with a large 
      population of Batfish. With a depth of 30 metres, this dive site is subject to strong ocean currents at times. These water 
      currents often carry dense shoals of barracuda and trevallies. Many types of angelfish can be found in these waters. Under 
      the days' rays, young sharks and turtles can also be seen. Divers of all levels can enjoy the Caravelle site, provided that 
      they are comfortable with strong water currents.

      Caravelle has an interesting topography with large rock formations, offering the possibility of a gentle drift. Schools of bats, 
      barracuda, snapper, grouper are often seen in Caravelle, with the opportunity to see eagle rays and stingrays.`,
