      `Le Morne Beach, under the shadow of the mighty Le Morne Brant mountains, is known as the ultimate surfing spot in the 
    country. This top Mauritius surf spot is famous for the ‘One Eye’, the ‘eye’ surfers see on Le Morne’s rock face when 
    they find the sweet spot in which to catch the perfect wave! If you’re a beginner, test your skills on the west side of 
    the peninsula. This location is also known as ‘Kite Lagoon’, due to it being a popular venue for kitesurfing in Mauritius. 
    Enjoy some of the best swells of incredibly high waves on the island (averaging 3.5 feet). You can rent a board at Pryde Shop, 
    which is less than a 10-minute drive from Le Morne Beach. Call them at +230 5989 1060. Open 09:00 to 19:00, every day.

    If the inconsistencies of Tamarin Bay leave you feeling a little out of your depth, then the surf at Le Morne Peninsula 
    will be your saviour. Le Morne is home to some of the best swells on the island, yet is arguably more hospitable for novice 
    surfers than areas such as Tamarin Bay.

    Tucked away in the farthest south-westerly corner of Mauritius, Le Morne will greet you with the call of the Roaring Forties – 
    the strong westerly winds found in the Southern Hemisphere. But you will also be welcomed by regular swells of impressively high waves.
    
    The award-winning adventure travel blog Ordinary Traveler shares many valuable travel tips for visiting Mauritius. Blog owner 
    Christy told us how Le Morne offers more than conventional surfing: “Mauritius is home to a world-class windsurfing spot — 
    right next to the St. Regis on Le Morne Peninsula. As long as it’s not too windy, you can paddle past the lagoon to One Eye 
    for some of the best waves in Mauritius.”
    
    Sheltered by Le Morne Brabant Mountain, this area has fewer rocks and less prominent reefs, meaning beginners can ply their trade 
    here with ease. The conditions range from lagoon-like calmness to more hard-core swells, perfect for those seeking a challenge.

    As Christy recommends, experienced surfers should head out to One Eye. This is an exposed reef break that can be found in front 
    of the St. Regis Hotel. To make the most of the superb swells, tackle the waves at high tide with some extremely fast currents to 
    propel you. Surfing legend says that if you manage to catch the perfect wave at One Eye and can ride it to the top, you will be 
    rewarded with a clear view of the break in the reef and the opening, or ‘eye’, in the face of Le Morne Mountain.

    Further out to sea is Manawa. Best reached by boat, this is another exposed reef break like One Eye. Here you are treated to 
    consistent large waves and strong south-easterly offshore winds.

    Shielded by the defensive look of Le Morne Brabant Mountain, the waters of the Le Morne cape are presently seemingly the most 
    prevalent spot to surf in Mauritius. About 30 minutes south of Tamarin Bay, on the island's far southwestern furthest point, Le 
    Morne offers both level tidal pond conditions for absolute amateurs to discover their ocean legs, and challenging surf spots for 
    experienced surfers to test their courage. One such spot – an uncovered reef break known as One Eye – is found just in front of 
    the St. Regis resort. It's best surfed at elevated tide when the tide is as yet rising, however with truly quick currents, it's 
    one for the specialist surfers only.

    Another professional surf spot with a genuine reputation is Manawa, a likewise uncovered reef break 2km out to ocean before 
    the Indian Resort and Spa. Best reached by a boat, you'll find reliably enormous waves and offshore breezes blowing in from 
    the southeast.

    Internationally recognised as one of the world’s best places to go kitesurfing, Le Morne is equally phenomenal (and famous) 
    for those wanting to hit the waves harness-free. Situated in the southwest of the island, surfers are afforded the opportunity 
    of surfing in Mauritius with a spectacular and unique view of one of the island’s UNESCO World Heritage Sites—Le Morne Brabant 
    mountain. The great news about this gorgeous spot on the Mauritian coastline is that it’s not reserved exclusively for experts: 
    The Le Morne lagoon makes for an excellent place for beginners to learn the art of surfing on the tamer swells, while experts 
    can look forward to the challenge of ‘Manawa’ or the famed ‘One Eye’.

    One Eye is best tackled during high tide (more specifically on the pushing tide as the water just starts to fill up on the bank).
    This difficult spot is famous for the exposed reef break but, searchers beware, the waves are made up of fast and steep, left-hand 
    peaks which break a lot heavier than expected and the currents can be strong. Manawa is just across the channel and offers a smaller, 
    slightly more manageable wave for most with this reef break handling anything from one metre to eight metre walls. It has also won 
    itself recognition amongst the pro surfers of the world, thanks to offshore southeasterly winds that create consistently solid waves.

    The easiest way to reach either of these spots is by speedboat and it’s a good idea to employ the services of the emergency 
    speedboats before you go into the water, especially if you are interested in testing your mettle with One Eye. The old surfer’s 
    adage ‘when in doubt, don’t go out’ couldn't be truer than when surfing some of the most challenging spots on the island. Something 
    for the general surfer to remember when surfing these two breaks is that they are kitesurfer havens and the line-up will be crowded 
    when the wind is up.`,

    The now-popular Tamarin Bay lies on the south-west coast of Mauritius, but until the 1960s it was relatively unknown. 
    Surfed only by locals and the most hard core Australian surfers, Tamarin Bay was a hidden treasure of a cove. It wasn’t 
    until the 1974 cult surfing documentary The Forgotten Island of Santosha exposed Tamarin Bay’s infamous 10-foot wave that 
    the Bay became more widely known. Its left-hand reef break became legendary, and surfing enthusiasts from around the world 
    began placing the Bay at the top of their bucket lists. Since the ’70s, the currents and wind patterns around the Bay have 
    changed, making the surf somewhat inconsistent for those hungry to relive the swell presented in the documentary. Instead, 
    surfers began heading for the nearby island of Réunion. Nonetheless, Tamarin Bay is still widely regarded as a world-class 
    place to surf. Tamarin Bay is certainly a spot for more experienced surfers, but there is a local surf school for children 
    or first-timers who are keen to learn surfing during their holiday to Mauritius. Unlike the northern side of the island, 
    this area of Mauritius has not seen the same level of development that you would expect of a tourist destination. Instead 
    Tamarin Bay has maintained the authentic and unique vibe that makes it perfectly suited to a surfing community.

    Close to Flic-en-Flac on the western side of the island, you’ll find one of the most famous spots to go surfing in Mauritius—Tamarin 
    Bay. Once a surf spot exclusively known to die-hard wave chasers and savvy locals (in the 1960s), Tamarin Bay was put on the 
    proverbial map by a film made in 1974 called Forgotten Island of Santosha and images from that film published by Surfer Magazine. 
    It didn’t take long for surfers across the world to set out on a surfing mission to Mauritius in search of Tamarin Bay’s ‘perfect wave’ 
    depicted in the film—a lengthy left-handed reef break—with sizeable three metre swells being handled with ease. In fact, this was 
    true to such an extent, that surfers nicknamed Mauritius the “Forgotten Island of Santosha” itself. At one point, the bay apparently 
    became so popular that some locals, especially white Mauritians called the “White Shorts” were concerned they would miss out and 
    visitors would monopolize the surf. Happily, this seems to be something of the past, and as long as locals are shown due respect and 
    you are prepared to wait for your turn patiently too—as is true for every other surf spot in the world famous or not—you won’t have 
    any trouble.
    
    While the movie might have captured Tamarin Bay at its absolute best, the reality is that the surf tends to be slightly inconsistent, 
    depending on the currents and wind patterns present, but when the conditions are optimal, it’s undoubtedly one of the best spots to 
    go surfing in Mauritius. It’s great to surf between eight and nine in the morning while conditions are most favourable and the area 
    uncrowded. When the right conditions do present themselves, it’s possible to surf huge, powerful waves that tend to barrel from the 
    take-off zone. The most reliable waves here occur from October onwards, and you generally have the chance to surf during all tides. 
    As with most reef breaks, it’s important to be very cautious if you are surfing here during low tide. While the big waves are 
    certainly best left to the professionals, there are areas in Tamarin Bay that are appropriate for beginners.
    
    If you are looking for an excellent place to stay during your trip to Mauritius, that’s just a stone’s throw from Tamarin Bay and 
    Le Morne, then look no further than Sugar Beach. Our exquisite plantation-style luxury hotel serves as the ideal place to rest and 
    relax after a long, albeit satisfying, day chasing perfect waves. And what’s more, we have a huge variety of complimentary activities 
    for days when the swell is just not up to scratch, from stand up paddle boarding to windsurfing, snorkelling and more. Get in touch 
    with us to plan your next surfing adventure in Mauritius.

    The significant surf seashores in Mauritius are all in the south and west of the island, and just beneath Flic en Flac on the 
    western coast is the best known of them all: the Tamarin Bay. Dating back to the 1960s, this was as yet a moderately obscure spot, 
    surfed distinctly by high-class local people in addition to a bunch of hardcore (predominantly Australian) wave chasers from abroad. 
    Actually, Tamarin’s popularity began when The Forgotten Island of Santosha was invented. It’s basically an elite 1974 surf narrative 
    that focused on the bay’s incredibly long left-hand reef break and its 10 foot long swells.

    Nowadays, changes in the currents and flows, along with the wind patterns have made Tamarin a far less predictable bet than in years 
    back, but when the water conditions are great, this is as yet a world-class spot to surf. In case you're a beginner, visit the surf 
    school at the imperatively retro Tamarin Hotel for exercises, or just fly in for a talk about the most recent wave conditions.
    
    Back ashore, an absence of large scale advancement implies that this place still holds something of an old-school vibe, making it a 
    particularly well-known destination for the more boho visitors.`,

      `One of the least developed areas of Mauritius, Rivière des Galets offers you a more peaceful atmosphere than some of the other 
    popular Mauritius surf spots. You can look forward to a rewarding surfing experience thanks to the left-hand surf breaks and the 
    moderately exposed reef. It’s a highly recommended location for more advanced surfers seeking consistent and phenomenal waves.

    Generally, the best places to go surfing in Mauritius are on the south and west coasts. The south coast itself offers some 
    incredible gems for the avid surfer, but Rivière des Galets could be deemed the crown jewel. Surrounded by incredible stretches 
    of tropical scenery, sheer cliffs and untouched coastlines, it’s an exceptional spot for advanced surfers seeking some phenomenal 
    waves that tend to be consistent, thanks to a partially exposed coral reef which forms a classic left-hand reef break. The rugged 
    pebble beach here stands out as being unusual on an island where the famed beaches are those with powdered white sandy shores. 
    This makes for not only an incredible surf spot—due to the water pulling harder off the rocks than it can off the sand—but an 
    amazing change in scenery.

    Once you travel about 20km further east along the twisting south coast street, you'll arrive at the town of Riviere des Galets. 
    Here you will find an uncovered reef and left-hand surf break, which will offer you with dependable waves in case you are a pro 
    surfer. It's additionally only an extraordinary spot to unwind and appreciate the characteristic setting – here on the south shore 
    of Mauritius you'll discover the islands most out of control and least created stretch of coastline, complete with dramatic ocean 
    cliffs and thrashing waves made by the gaps in the reef.

    Just toward the west of the town itself, the minor Ilôt Sancho – which, being only a couple of meters offshore, is easily accessible 
    by foot during low tide – offers both left and right-hand reef breaks and trustworthy surf conditions. In spite of being less notable 
    among guests than either Le Morne or Tamarin Bay, this has regularly been an area for local surf competitions and can get truly 
    bustling when the conditions are correct. What's more, if, for reasons unknown you don't like getting your shorts wet, it's likewise 
    an incredible spot to just sit back, relax and have a glimpse of the natural beauty.

    Rivière des Galets is a small village 20km further east of Le Morne and Tamarin Bay. More reliable than Tamarin, the left-hand surf 
    breaks and moderately exposed reef of the Rivière des Galets offers surf that is consistently rewarding.

    What puts Rivière des Galets among the best surf locations in Mauritius isn’t only the waves, but is also the peaceful atmosphere of 
    the area. This part of the island is certainly one of the least developed, and the community remains truly in touch with their natural 
    surroundings.
    
    Countless subtle surprises can be found in the Rivière des Galets. Its pebble beach is unique within Mauritius, creating a charming

      as chances to see large pelagics such as marlin. Its unique geology makes for some interesting underwater canyons and crevices 
      that can be quite fun to swim through.

      vessel sitting perfectly upright at a depth of approximately 100ft/30m. Completely covered in beautiful pink soft coral, the 
      wreck attracts perhaps the largest concentration of fish life on the north side of the island. Octopus, scorpionfish, stonefish, 
      lionfish, and many reef fish are common here. Less common are barracuda, dolphins, and sting rays.

      `St. Jacques is one of the most popular sites for scuba diving in Mauritius. The diving trip starts in the lagoon, which is less 
      than 5 metres deep. The water currents then take the divers away to the coral walls and underwater caves. Rock pinnacles will also 
      be visible in these waters.

      The maximum depth is about 30 metres where the drift drive ends. In these waters, one can come across eagle rays, stingrays, 
      turtles, reef sharks and few other large species.  This dive is not suitable for beginners due to strong currents. The best time 
      for diving here is the period between November and May. Blue gorgonian fans, hard and soft corals, sharks, schools of trevallies, 
      and Tuna can also be seen.

      Kind of maybe more the south coast but you can reach Passe St Jacques from Le Morne so it still counts! It’s another choice but 
      reserved for the advanced divers due to the technicality of the site. Drift-diving means diving using transportation by the 
      underwater currents and the pull at Passe St Jacques is known for getting pretty strong.

      How’s the reward though? Smashing.

      The underwater life here is superb with a huge variety of ecosystems interacting. It’s not just the pacifists either. This is a 
      real good spot to see some of Mauritius’s underwater predators as they loiter the current waiting for outgoing prey.

      Eagle rays, barracudas, and even sharks are a real possibility here as well as schools of different fish like trevallies and 
      tuna. If you’re keen to see the merciless savagery of nature at its finest (as things are devoured before your very eyes), it’s 
      the best place to go in Mauritius!`,

      `An ideal site for photography enthusiasts, the Cathedral has excellent topography. With grand caverns, caves and arches, 
      these waters give an incredible sight. To experience the sandy ocean floor, one has to dive to a depth of 30 metres, which 
      is also the deepest point of the Cathedral. Many different marine species like angelfish, wrasse, clownfish and groupers can 
      be found in these waters. One has to keep an eye on moray eels and few crustaceans, which often hide in the coral crevices.
      
      <!-- https://www.thebrokebackpacker.com/best-diving-in-mauritius-guide/ -->
      A complex and devastating underwater array, the Cathedral dive site in Mauritius is quite possibly its most world-renowned. 
      Sudden drop-offs and some majestic boulder formations have created a structure that’s a proverbial playground for the divemasters 
      and divepadawans alike.

      Starting from 18 m before the very sharp drop to the 30 m floor, the topography of Cathedral is wild! Featuring caves, holes, 
      chimneys, and cavities, the rocky scene is home to a teeming reef life as well as pods of lobsters scouring the depths for their next 
      bloodlust-enraged duel.

      If you have the appropriate level of experience, this is a must-visit place below Mauritius. This is some of the best scuba 
      diving Mauritius has to offer.`,

      <!-- Credit: 'Holidify' -> https://www.holidify.com/pages/scuba-diving-in-mauritius-783.html -->
      With an abundance of fish and coral life, Grand Bay Aquarium contains a large reef that is divided by a sand gully. This created 
      a gap between the reef with walls as high as 3 metres on the sides. Due to the crystal clear water, you can have a good sight of 
      a variety of marine life. The sandy white ocean floor is a delight to your eyes as it radiated light into the water.

      The site offers a good view of underwater photography and video. It looks like an oasis which illuminated a medley of Fauna.  
      One special feature of this site for scuba diving in Mauritius is a giant moray eel, named Henry that is an adorable addition to the 
      experience!

      Stella Maru is an old Japanese trawler that sunk into the waters in 1987. This wreck attracted marine wildlife after leading to 
      it being declared as an artificial reef. The series of reefs are colonised by a variety of aquatic species like butterflyfish, 
      damsels, bannerfish, lionfish, surgeonfish and many more.

      The dive site is also home to two giant moray eels, one of which lives in the chimneys of the wreck. Octopuses, barracuda, leaf 
      scorpionfish, shellfish and domino damsels are also found in this site. The speciality of this site, the wreck, has so much for
