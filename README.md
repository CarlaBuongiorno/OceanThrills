# Ocean Thrills - Mauritius


[View the live site here](https://carlabuongiorno.github.io/OceanThrills/)

Ocean Thrills is an interactive website incorporating various technological elements to offer users a tool to discover and explore different water activities in Mauritius. It offers a _google map_ for each of the activities with _markers_ pinned at the various locations that are best to enjoy that particular activity. Each marker can be _clicked_ and _information_ about that location with regards to the relevant activity is then displayed in a _window_ above the clicked marker on the map, as well as in a _side panel_ on larger screens.

## 2. UXD â€“ User Experience Design

The target demographic are users who are holiday makers in Mauritius, as well as locals, looking to enjoy themselves with some extra sea and underwater activities.

#### Visitor Goals

Visitors to this website are searching for things to do on the island of Mauritius, in particular, water and undersea activities. They wish to locate these activities on a Google Map, and find some of the best locations to enjoy them. Visitors wish to learn more about the locations that the activities are situated, in respect of that activity. They wish to do this easily in an interactive, exciting and thrilling manner, anticipating the adventures to come.

#### Ocean Thrills Goals

Ocean Thrills is the best way to help users achieve their goals because it is easy to navigate, whether by mobile, tablet, or desktop. The navigation bar is always in the viewport no matter where in the site the user has navigated to.

The site is designed so that upon entering, the user immediately anticipates a sense of adventure and fun, and feels impelled to interact with the site.

Ocean Thrills provides an effective, easy to use site for adventurers in Mauritius to explore the sea and underwater activities that are available around the island.

In return for this investment, the site owner would make use of this website, have a professional looking first step into the world of using JavaScript, jQuery and APIs, and an exciting and thrilling project to make a part of her portfolio.

### Wireframes

- [Wireframes:](assets/images/readme-images/wireframes/desktop-tablet.png) Desktop and tablet version.
- [Wireframes:](assets/images/readme-images/wireframes/small-screen.png) Small screen version. 

### Design Choices

#### Colours

I decided to go with blue and white as the main colours of this website. These two colours are most associated with nautical decorating. Many holiday homes are decorated using blue and white.

Blue is the colour of the sky on a sunny day, and the colour of the ocean. White is the contrast colour of the light and fluffy clouds in the sky, and the foam that the ocean waves have created.  

In using these colours for my design, it is my intention to evoke happy, holiday emotions in the site visitor.

#### Typography

I selected 2 different fonts for this site: 

1. "Parisienne", (cursive) - For the logo.
2. "Open Sans", (sans-serif) - For the main content for contrast and ease of reading.

#### Icons

Icons were chosen for their obvious meaning and bring a sense of fun and adventure to the user.

#### Images

The images I selected are packed with adventure and beauty. The intention is to bring a typical 'holiday island vibe' to the site.

## 5. Testing
<!-- Various tools and validators were used to check that the site works well. Initially a few errors and suggestions resulted after running the URL through these tools and validators, but after correcting and implementing these errors and suggestions, all tests resulted positively. -->

### HTML Validation
<!-- The HTML of the website was validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). ([See result](https://github.com/CarlaBuongiorno/MilestoneProject1/blob/master/assets/readme-images/testing/html.png)) -->

### CSS Validation
<!-- The CSS of the website was validated using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). ([See result](https://github.com/CarlaBuongiorno/MilestoneProject1/blob/master/assets/readme-images/testing/css.png)) -->

### Link Validation
<!-- The links of the website (except the Facebook link) were validated using the [W3C Link Checker](https://validator.w3.org/checklink). The Facebook link was not checked due to robots exclusion rules, but I validated the link manually. ([See result](https://github.com/CarlaBuongiorno/MilestoneProject1/blob/master/assets/readme-images/testing/links.png)) -->

### Accessibility
<!-- The accessibility of the website was evaluated using the [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/). ([See result](https://github.com/CarlaBuongiorno/MilestoneProject1/blob/master/assets/readme-images/testing/accessibility.png)) -->

<!-- - There is one alert about adding captions to the video. Because this is an embedded YouTube video, YouTube enables the user to switch on 'Captions'. This specific video has no voices, therefore the alert becomes irrelevant. -->

### Performance
<!-- The overall performance of the website was evaluated using [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/run) ([See result](https://github.com/CarlaBuongiorno/MilestoneProject1/blob/master/assets/readme-images/testing/lighthouse.png)), as well as [Web Page Test](https://www.webpagetest.org/).

### Other Testing
<!-- - The Subscription form will not submit until name and email fields are filled out. If a user tries to submit without these fields filled, an alert will apper.
- If the email field is filled incorrectly, an error of 'Please include an @ in the email address' is presented to the user.
- Tested all links within the site take the user to the appropriate pages.
- If an incorrect URL is attempted the user is redirected to a 404 page which will direct them back to the home page.
- Website is responsive on  mobile, tablet and large screens. -->

4. As a site visitor, I wish to know more about these activities in Mauritius.
5. As a site visitor, I wish to find the best locations within Mauritius in order to take part in these water activities.

Carefully chosen fonts, colours, images and text; as well as the recipes and video tutorial, all work together in a way that leaves the user feeling inspired.

4. As a site visitor, I wish to be able to subscribe to a newsletter in order to have access the latest recipes.

Checked the site footer displays social media icons, clicking on an icon takes the user to that social media page in a new window.
 -->

## 6. Project barriers and solutions

- Navbar menu items would not align to the right with Bootstrap _justify-content-end_ class, to fix this it had to be replaced with the _ml-auto_ class. Credit to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61174994/bootstrap-justify-content-end-not-working-as-expected).

- Had trouble forming a function to show one activity and hide the other activities. Through the help of Slack, this was overcome by using the CSS display: 'block' and display: 'none' properties.

- In order to get the above function to listen to the 'click' events, much research and assitance was necessary. Code Institute's Tutor support helped with this tremendously. 

- Markers seemed not to be displaying on all five maps. In reality the markers were displaying in Greenland instead of where was expected. The problem was that the latitude and longitude numbers were reversed. 

<!-- - The footer on the _Activities_ page for medium screen and larger did not sit at the bottom of the page as expected. To fix this the footer for only the _Activities_ page was given the position: 'absolute' and 'bottom' was set to '0'. Credit to [Coding Journey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=US_3XvufMLU). -->
